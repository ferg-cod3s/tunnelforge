## Recent Additions Without Tests

### Terminal Rendering Enhancements
The recent upgrade to GPU-accelerated terminal rendering lacks test coverage:
- `terminal-webgl.js` - WebGL acceleration implementation
- `terminal-blocks.js` - Block-based command architecture
- Performance monitoring utilities
- Fallback rendering strategies

### Bun Migration
The migration from npm to Bun has been completed but lacks specific tests for:
- Bun-specific build processes
- Package resolution differences
- Runtime performance benchmarks

## Test Execution Issues

### Current Problems
1. **Bun Test Runner Crashes**: The Bun test runner is experiencing crashes when running the full test suite
2. **Vitest Configuration**: Tests run but with some failures (17 failed, 1428 passed)
3. **Unhandled Exceptions**: Two uncaught exceptions in session-view tests related to `requestAnimationFrame`

### Test Environment Issues
- Missing `requestAnimationFrame` in test environment
- Timeout cleanup issues in component tests
- Mock setup for WebGL and Canvas rendering contexts needed

## Priority Areas for Test Coverage Improvement

### High Priority (Security & Core Functionality)
1. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - Local bypass authentication
   - Session token validation
   - User permission checks

2. **Session Management**
   - Session creation/destruction
   - Session persistence
   - Session state synchronization

3. **Terminal Rendering**
   - WebGL fallback mechanisms
   - Performance benchmarks
   - Command block operations

### Medium Priority (Features & UX)
1. **Command History**
   - Block-based history navigation
   - Command replay functionality
   - Search and filter operations

2. **File Operations**
   - File upload/download
   - Binary file handling
   - Path validation

3. **Power Management**
   - Sleep/wake detection
   - Session recovery
   - State persistence

### Low Priority (Nice-to-Have)
1. **UI Components**
   - Theme switching
   - Responsive layouts
   - Accessibility features

2. **Performance Monitoring**
   - FPS tracking
   - Memory usage
   - Network latency

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Fix Test Environment**:
   ```bash
   # Add to test setup
   global.requestAnimationFrame = (cb) => setTimeout(cb, 0);
   global.cancelAnimationFrame = (id) => clearTimeout(id);
   ```

2. **Create Critical Tests**:
   - Authentication flow tests
   - WebGL terminal rendering tests
   - Session lifecycle tests

3. **Establish Coverage Targets**:
   - Minimum 70% coverage for new code
   - 80% coverage for critical paths
   - 60% overall project coverage

### Long-term Strategy
1. **Adopt Test-Driven Development (TDD)** for new features
2. **Implement Continuous Integration** with coverage gates
3. **Create Integration Tests** for end-to-end workflows
4. **Add Performance Benchmarks** for terminal rendering

## Test Infrastructure Improvements

### Needed Test Utilities
1. **Mock Factories**:
   - Terminal mock with WebGL/Canvas
   - WebSocket connection mocks
   - File system mocks

2. **Test Helpers**:
   - Session creation helpers
   - Authentication helpers
   - Command execution helpers

3. **E2E Test Suite**:
   - Playwright tests for critical user flows
   - Performance regression tests
   - Cross-browser compatibility tests

## Coverage Metrics Goals

### Q4 2025 Targets
- Overall Coverage: **60%**
- Critical Path Coverage: **80%**
- New Code Coverage: **70%**

### Q1 2026 Targets
- Overall Coverage: **70%**
- Critical Path Coverage: **90%**
- New Code Coverage: **80%**

## Conclusion

While TunnelForge has a foundation of tests, significant gaps exist, particularly in:
1. Recently added terminal rendering features
2. Server-side code
3. Security-critical components

The immediate focus should be on:
1. Fixing the test environment issues
2. Adding tests for the new WebGL terminal and block-based architecture
3. Ensuring authentication and session management are thoroughly tested

With the Bun migration complete, establishing a robust test suite should be the next priority to ensure reliability and maintainability as the project grows.
