# Commit Changes

You are tasked with creating git commits for the changes made during this session. This command uses intelligent caching to optimize performance and maintain consistency across similar commit operations.

## Purpose

Create atomic, well-structured git commits that follow conventional commit standards and group related changes logically.

## Inputs

- **git_status**: Current repository status showing modified files
- **git_diff**: Detailed diff of changes to be committed
- **conversation_context**: History of changes made in this session

## Preconditions

- Git repository is initialized and clean (no uncommitted changes in staging area)
- All changes have been reviewed and approved
- Repository is in a valid state for committing

## Process Phases

### Phase 1: Context Analysis & Cache Check

1. **Check Cache First**: Query cache for similar commit patterns using conversation context hash
2. **Analyze Changes**: Review git status and diff to understand scope and nature of changes
3. **Determine Commit Strategy**: Decide on single vs. multiple commits based on change patterns

### Phase 2: Commit Planning

1. **Group Related Files**: Identify logical groupings based on functionality and file types
2. **Draft Commit Messages**: Create conventional commit messages following project standards
3. **Validate Commit Structure**: Ensure commits will be atomic and focused

### Phase 3: Execution & Verification

1. **Stage Files Selectively**: Use `git add` with specific file paths (never `-A` or `.`)
2. **Create Commits**: Execute commits with planned messages
3. **Update Cache**: Store successful commit patterns for future reference

## Error Handling

### Repository State Errors

```error-context
{
  "command": "commit",
  "phase": "precondition_check",
  "error_type": "repository_state",
  "expected": "Clean working directory",
  "found": "Uncommitted changes in staging area",
  "mitigation": "Stash or commit existing changes first",
  "requires_user_input": true
}
```

### No Changes Error

```error-context
{
  "command": "commit",
  "phase": "analysis",
  "error_type": "no_changes",
  "expected": "Modified files to commit",
  "found": "Working directory clean",
  "mitigation": "No action needed - no changes to commit",
  "requires_user_input": false
}
```

## Structured Output Specification

### Primary Output

```command-output:commit_plan
{
  "status": "success|planning|error",
  "timestamp": "ISO-8601",

    "hit": true|false,

      "message": "add user authentication system",

    },
    {
      "type": "docs",
      "scope": "api",

    }

  }
}
```

## Success Criteria

#### Automated Verification

- [ ] Git repository remains in clean state after commits
- [ ] All specified files are committed
- [ ] Commit messages follow conventional format
- [ ] No merge conflicts or git errors
- [ ] Cache updated with successful patterns

#### Manual Verification

- [ ] Commit history shows logical grouping of changes
- [ ] Commit messages are clear and descriptive
- [ ] Each commit represents a single, focused change
- [ ] Repository status shows clean working directory

## Edge Cases

### Large Diff Handling

- For diffs > 1000 lines, suggest breaking into multiple focused commits
- Cache large diff patterns to optimize future similar operations

### Binary Files

- Handle binary files appropriately (don't diff, but include in commits)
- Cache binary file commit patterns separately

### Partial Staging

- Detect when only some changes should be committed
- Provide clear guidance on selective staging

## Anti-Patterns

### Avoid These Practices

- **Mass commits**: Don't commit all changes as one large commit
- **Vague messages**: Avoid generic messages like "fix bug" or "update code"
- **Mixed concerns**: Don't mix feature changes with refactoring in same commit
- **Cache bypass**: Don't skip cache checks for performance reasons

## Caching Guidelines

### Cache Usage Patterns

- **Pattern caching**: Store successful commit grouping patterns
- **Message templates**: Cache conventional commit message structures
- **File grouping**: Remember successful file grouping strategies

## Enhanced Subagent Orchestration for Commit Management

### Comprehensive Commit Workflow

For structured commit creation requiring change analysis and validation:

#### Phase 1: Change Analysis & Validation (Parallel)

- **codebase-locator**: Identify all changed files and their relationships
- **codebase-analyzer**: Understand the nature and impact of code changes
- **thoughts-analyzer**: Review change documentation and implementation notes
- **codebase-pattern-finder**: Identify change patterns and grouping opportunities
- **code-reviewer**: Validate code quality before committing

#### Phase 2: Commit Planning & Organization (Sequential)

- **full-stack-developer**: Validate technical correctness of changes
- **system-architect**: Assess architectural impact of changes
- **api-builder**: Verify API contract changes are properly documented
- **database-expert**: Validate database schema and migration changes
- **security-scanner**: Ensure security changes are properly implemented

#### Phase 3: Quality Assurance Validation (Parallel)

- **test-generator**: Verify test changes are included and comprehensive
- **quality-testing-performance-tester**: Validate performance impact of changes
- **compliance-expert**: Ensure regulatory compliance changes are complete
- **accessibility-pro**: Verify accessibility changes are properly implemented
- **monitoring-expert**: Validate monitoring and alerting changes

#### Phase 4: Documentation & Communication (Sequential)

- **thoughts-analyzer**: Ensure documentation changes are included
- **content-writer**: Validate user-facing documentation updates
- **content-localization-coordinator**: Verify internationalization changes
- **deployment-wizard**: Ensure deployment-related changes are complete

#### Phase 5: Final Validation & Commit (Parallel)

- **infrastructure-builder**: Validate infrastructure changes are complete
- **devops-operations-specialist**: Verify operational changes are ready
- **cost-optimizer**: Validate cost-related changes are appropriate
- **code-reviewer**: Final comprehensive quality assessment

### Commit Orchestration Best Practices

1. **Change Analysis**: Always analyze the scope and impact of changes before committing
2. **Quality Validation**: Use code-reviewer and domain experts to validate changes
3. **Atomic Commits**: Group related changes into logical, independent commits
4. **Documentation Updates**: Ensure all documentation changes are included
5. **Testing Validation**: Verify test changes are comprehensive and passing
6. **Security Review**: Validate security implications of changes

### Commit Quality Gates

- **Code Quality**: All changes pass code review standards
- **Test Coverage**: Adequate tests included for all changes
- **Documentation**: Documentation updated for all user-facing changes
- **Security**: Security implications reviewed and addressed
- **Performance**: Performance impact assessed and acceptable
- **Compliance**: Regulatory requirements properly addressed
- **Atomicity**: Each commit represents a single, coherent change

### Commit Optimization Strategies

- **Logical Grouping**: Group related changes into atomic commits
- **Conventional Messages**: Use standardized commit message formats
- **Change Validation**: Validate each commit meets quality standards
- **Incremental Commits**: Commit frequently with small, focused changes
- **Revert Readiness**: Ensure each commit can be safely reverted if needed
- **Branch Strategy**: Follow established branching and merging practices

### Cache Invalidation Triggers

- **Manual**: Clear cache when commit conventions change
- **Content-based**: Invalidate when repository structure changes significantly
- **Time-based**: Refresh cache every 5 minutes for active development

### Performance Optimization

- Cache hit rate target: ≥ 70% for repeated commit patterns
- Memory usage: < 10MB for commit pattern cache
- Response time: < 50ms for cache queries
