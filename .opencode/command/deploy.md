## Deployment Strategy Framework

### Deployment Strategies

- **Blue-Green**: Full environment switch with instant rollback capability
- **Canary**: Gradual rollout with traffic shifting and validation
- **Rolling**: Sequential instance updates with health monitoring
- **Recreate**: Stop old version, deploy new version (downtime expected)

### Deployment Best Practices

- **Incremental Rollout**: Deploy to smaller environments first (dev → staging → production)
- **Monitoring Integration**: Track metrics continuously during deployment
- **Automated Rollback**: Enable automatic rollback on critical failure detection
- **Communication**: Notify stakeholders at each deployment phase
- **Documentation**: Maintain deployment runbooks and post-mortems

## Pre-Deployment Validation Guidelines

### Build Artifact Validation

- **Artifact Integrity**: Verify checksums and signatures
- **Dependency Verification**: Confirm all dependencies are available
- **Configuration Validation**: Ensure environment-specific configs are correct
- **Security Scanning**: Check for vulnerabilities and compliance issues

### Infrastructure Readiness

- **Capacity Check**: Verify sufficient resources (CPU, memory, storage)
- **Network Connectivity**: Confirm network paths and firewall rules
- **Service Dependencies**: Validate external services are available
- **Backup Status**: Ensure recovery points exist for rollback

## Deployment Execution Best Practices

### Deployment Monitoring

- **Real-Time Metrics**: Track deployment progress and health indicators
- **Log Aggregation**: Centralize logs for immediate issue detection
- **Error Detection**: Monitor for errors and anomalies during deployment
- **Performance Tracking**: Compare metrics to established baselines

### Migration Management

- **Database Migrations**: Execute schema changes with rollback capability
- **Data Transformations**: Apply data migrations with validation
- **Backward Compatibility**: Ensure migrations don't break existing functionality
- **Migration Testing**: Validate migrations in non-production environments first

## Post-Deployment Verification Guidelines

### Health Check Validation

- **Endpoint Testing**: Verify all service endpoints respond correctly
- **Dependency Checks**: Confirm external service integrations work
- **Database Connectivity**: Validate database connections and queries
- **Cache Warmup**: Ensure caches are populated and performing

### Smoke Test Execution

- **Critical Paths**: Test essential user workflows immediately
- **Integration Tests**: Verify component interactions function correctly
- **Performance Tests**: Confirm response times are acceptable
- **Security Tests**: Validate authentication and authorization work

## Rollback Procedures

### Automatic Rollback Triggers

- **Critical Health Check Failure**: Service health checks fail after deployment
- **Excessive Error Rate**: Error rates exceed acceptable thresholds
- **Performance Degradation**: Response times significantly worse than baseline
- **Smoke Test Failures**: Critical smoke tests fail post-deployment

### Rollback Execution

- **Immediate Detection**: Identify rollback triggers within minutes
- **Automated Execution**: Execute rollback procedure automatically
- **State Recovery**: Restore database and application state
- **Verification**: Confirm rollback completed successfully
- **Notification**: Alert stakeholders of rollback and reasons

## Edge Cases

### Partial Deployment Failures

- Identify which components deployed successfully
- Determine if partial rollback is needed
- Assess impact on dependent services
- Execute appropriate recovery procedure

### Migration Rollback Challenges

- Handle data migrations that cannot be easily reversed
- Maintain data consistency during rollback
- Communicate data state to dependent systems
- Document migration rollback limitations

### Zero-Downtime Requirements

- Use blue-green or canary strategies for no downtime
- Maintain backward compatibility during transition
- Ensure database migrations support old and new versions
- Validate traffic routing during deployment

## Anti-Patterns

### Avoid These Practices

- **Skip validation**: Never skip pre-deployment validation checks
- **Manual deployments**: Avoid manual deployment steps without automation
- **No rollback plan**: Never deploy without tested rollback capability
- **Insufficient monitoring**: Don't deploy without comprehensive monitoring
- **Cache bypass**: Don't skip cache checks for performance reasons

## Caching Guidelines

## Enhanced Subagent Orchestration for Deployment
