## Debugging Strategy Framework

### Issue Reproduction Strategies

- **Direct Reproduction**: Follow exact steps provided in issue report
- **Simplified Reproduction**: Create minimal reproduction case
- **Environment Simulation**: Replicate production environment conditions
- **Automated Reproduction**: Create automated test that triggers issue

### Root Cause Analysis Techniques

- **Stack Trace Analysis**: Examine error call stacks and exception details
- **Code Path Tracing**: Follow execution flow through affected components
- **State Inspection**: Analyze application state at failure point
- **Binary Search**: Isolate problematic code through systematic testing
- **Hypothesis Testing**: Systematically test potential root causes

## Issue Reproduction Best Practices

### Evidence Collection

- **Error Logs**: Gather complete error messages and stack traces
- **System Metrics**: Collect CPU, memory, network metrics during issue
- **Application State**: Capture relevant state and configuration
- **Reproduction Steps**: Document exact steps that trigger the issue
- **Environment Details**: Record environment configuration and dependencies

### Reproduction Verification

- **Consistent Reproduction**: Verify issue occurs reliably with same steps
- **Isolation**: Confirm issue is not caused by unrelated factors
- **Minimal Case**: Reduce reproduction to simplest possible scenario
- **Documentation**: Record all reproduction findings clearly

## Root Cause Analysis Guidelines

### Analysis Techniques

- **Log Analysis**: Examine logs for error patterns and sequences
- **Code Review**: Inspect code paths related to failure
- **Debugging Tools**: Use debuggers, profilers, and tracing tools
- **Dependency Analysis**: Check external service and library interactions
- **Historical Analysis**: Review recent changes that may be related

### Hypothesis Testing

- **Formulate Hypotheses**: Develop testable theories about root cause
- **Design Experiments**: Create tests to validate or invalidate hypotheses
- **Systematic Testing**: Test hypotheses methodically and document results
- **Evidence-Based Conclusions**: Base conclusions on concrete evidence

## Fix Implementation Best Practices

### Solution Design

- **Address Root Cause**: Fix underlying issue, not just symptoms
- **Minimal Changes**: Make smallest change that resolves the issue
- **Maintainability**: Ensure fix is understandable and maintainable
- **Performance**: Validate fix doesn't introduce performance issues
- **Security**: Ensure fix doesn't create security vulnerabilities

### Code Quality

- **Follow Conventions**: Adhere to project coding standards
- **Add Comments**: Document why fix is needed and how it works
- **Error Handling**: Include appropriate error handling
- **Edge Cases**: Handle boundary conditions and error scenarios

## Regression Testing Guidelines

### Test Design

- **Reproduction Tests**: Create tests that reproduce original issue
- **Fix Validation**: Verify fix resolves issue in all scenarios
- **Edge Case Coverage**: Test boundary conditions and error cases
- **Integration Coverage**: Validate interactions with other components
- **Performance Tests**: Ensure fix maintains performance requirements

### Test Implementation

- **Clear Test Names**: Use descriptive names explaining what is tested
- **Specific Assertions**: Use precise assertions, not generic checks
- **Isolated Tests**: Ensure tests are independent and repeatable
- **Documentation**: Document why each test exists and what it prevents

## Edge Cases

### Intermittent Issues

- Increase reproduction attempts to identify patterns
- Add instrumentation to capture state when issue occurs
- Use statistical analysis to identify triggers
- Create tests that handle non-deterministic behavior

### Environment-Specific Issues

- Reproduce in target environment or create accurate simulation
- Identify environment-specific configuration differences
- Document environment requirements for reproduction
- Test fix in target environment before deploying

### Performance-Related Issues

- Use profiling tools to identify bottlenecks
- Create performance benchmarks before and after fix
- Validate fix under load conditions
- Monitor resource usage patterns

## Anti-Patterns

### Avoid These Practices

- **Symptom fixing**: Don't fix symptoms without addressing root cause
- **Rushed analysis**: Don't skip thorough investigation to save time
- **Insufficient testing**: Don't deploy fixes without comprehensive testing
- **Poor documentation**: Don't leave fixes undocumented for future reference
- **Cache bypass**: Don't skip cache checks for performance reasons

## Caching Guidelines

## Enhanced Subagent Orchestration for Debugging

### Comprehensive Debugging Workflow

6. **Knowledge Capture**: Document debugging insights for future reference

### Debugging Quality Gates

- **Reproduction Confirmed**: Issue reliably reproduced before proceeding
- **Root Cause Identified**: Clear understanding of underlying issue
- **Fix Validated**: Fix resolves issue without introducing regressions
- **Code Quality**: Fix reviewed and approved by code-reviewer
- **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive regression tests created and passing

- **Documentation Complete**: Issue resolution thoroughly documented

### Debugging Risk Mitigation

- **Systematic Investigation**: Follow structured debugging process
- **Hypothesis Testing**: Test theories systematically with evidence
- **Incremental Fixes**: Implement and test changes incrementally

- **Code Review**: Include expert review of all fix implementations
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track performance impact of fixes

### Cache Usage Patterns

- **Issue patterns**: Store successful debugging approaches for similar issues
- **Root cause patterns**: Cache common root cause analysis techniques
- **Fix strategies**: Remember effective fix implementation patterns

### Cache Invalidation Triggers

- **Manual**: Clear cache when debugging methodology changes
- **Content-based**: Invalidate when issue characteristics change significantly
- **Time-based**: Refresh cache every 30 minutes during active debugging

### Performance Optimization

- Cache hit rate target: ≥ 65% for repeated issue patterns
- Memory usage: < 20MB for debugging pattern cache
- Response time: < 75ms for cache queries
