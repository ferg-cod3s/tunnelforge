## Quick Start

### Requirements

**VibeTunnel requires an Apple Silicon Mac (M1+).** Intel Macs are not supported.

### 1. Download & Install

[Download VibeTunnel](https://github.com/amantus-ai/vibetunnel/releases/latest) and drag it to your Applications folder.

### 2. Launch VibeTunnel

VibeTunnel lives in your menu bar. Click the icon to start the server.

### 3. Use the `vt` Command

```bash
# Run any command in the browser
vt pnpm run dev

# Monitor AI agents (with automatic activity tracking)
vt claude --dangerously-skip-permissions

# Control terminal titles
vt --title-mode static npm run dev    # Shows path and command
vt --title-mode dynamic python app.py  # Shows path, command, and activity
vt --title-mode filter vim            # Blocks vim from changing title

# Shell aliases work automatically!
vt claude-danger  # Your custom aliases are resolved

# Open an interactive shell
vt --shell
```

## Architecture

VibeTunnel consists of three main components:

1. **macOS Menu Bar App** - Native Swift application that manages the server lifecycle
2. **Node.js/Bun Server** - High-performance TypeScript server handling terminal sessions
3. **Web Frontend** - Modern web interface using Lit components and xterm.js

The server runs as a standalone Bun executable with embedded Node.js modules, providing excellent performance and minimal resource usage.

## Remote Access Options

### Option 1: Tailscale (Recommended)

[Tailscale](https://tailscale.com) creates a secure peer-to-peer VPN network between your devices. It's the most secure option as traffic stays within your private network without exposing VibeTunnel to the public internet.

**How it works**: Tailscale creates an encrypted WireGuard tunnel between your devices, allowing them to communicate as if they were on the same local network, regardless of their physical location.

**Setup Guide**:
1. Install Tailscale on your Mac: [Download from Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tailscale/id1475387142) or [Direct Download](https://tailscale.com/download/macos)
2. Install Tailscale on your remote device:
   - **iOS**: [Download from App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tailscale/id1470499037)
   - **Android**: [Download from Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tailscale.ipn)
   - **Other platforms**: [All Downloads](https://tailscale.com/download)
3. Sign in to both devices with the same account
4. Find your Mac's Tailscale hostname in the Tailscale menu bar app (e.g., `my-mac.tailnet-name.ts.net`)
5. Access VibeTunnel at `http://[your-tailscale-hostname]:4020`

**Benefits**:
- End-to-end encrypted traffic
- No public internet exposure
- Works behind NAT and firewalls
- Zero configuration after initial setup

### Option 2: ngrok

[ngrok](https://ngrok.com) creates secure tunnels to your localhost, making VibeTunnel accessible via a public URL. Perfect for quick sharing or temporary access.

**How it works**: ngrok establishes a secure tunnel from a public endpoint to your local VibeTunnel server, handling SSL/TLS encryption and providing a unique URL for access.

**Setup Guide**:
1. Create a free ngrok account: [Sign up for ngrok](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/signup)
2. Copy your auth token from the [ngrok dashboard](https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken)
3. Add the token in VibeTunnel settings (Settings → Remote Access → ngrok)
4. Enable ngrok tunneling in VibeTunnel
5. Share the generated `https://[random].ngrok-free.app` URL

**Benefits**:
- Public HTTPS URL with SSL certificate
- No firewall configuration needed
- Built-in request inspection and replay
- Custom domains available (paid plans)

**Note**: Free ngrok URLs change each time you restart the tunnel. Consider a paid plan for persistent URLs.

### Option 3: Local Network
1. Set a dashboard password in settings
2. Switch to "Network" mode
3. Access via `http://[your-mac-ip]:4020`

### Option 4: Cloudflare Quick Tunnel
1. Install [cloudflared](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/downloads/)
2. Run `cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:4020`
3. Access via the generated `*.trycloudflare.com` URL

## Terminal Title Management

VibeTunnel provides intelligent terminal title management to help you track what's happening in each session:

### Title Modes

- **Dynamic Mode** (default for web UI): Shows working directory, command, and real-time activity
  - Generic activity: `~/projects — npm — •`
  - Claude status: `~/projects — claude — ✻ Crafting (45s, ↑2.1k)`
  
- **Static Mode**: Shows working directory and command
  - Example: `~/projects/app — npm run dev`
  
- **Filter Mode**: Blocks all title changes from applications
  - Useful when you have your own terminal management system
  
- **None Mode**: No title management - applications control their own titles

### Activity Detection

Dynamic mode includes real-time activity detection:
- Shows `•` when there's terminal output within 5 seconds
- Claude commands show specific status (Crafting, Transitioning, etc.)
- Extensible system for future app-specific detectors
## Building from Source

### Prerequisites
- macOS 14.0+ (Sonoma) on Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3)
- Xcode 16.0+
- Node.js 20+

## macOS Permissions

macOS is finicky when it comes to permissions. The system will only remember the first path from where an app requests permissions. If subsequently the app starts somewhere else, it will silently fail. Fix: Delete the entry and restart settings, restart app and next time the permission is requested, there should be an entry in Settings again.

Important: You need to set your Developer ID in Local.xcconfig. If apps are signed Ad-Hoc, each new signing will count as a new app for macOS and the permissions have to be (deleted and) requested again.

**Debug vs Release Bundle IDs**: The Debug configuration uses a different bundle identifier (`sh.vibetunnel.vibetunnel.debug`) than Release (`sh.vibetunnel.vibetunnel`). This allows you to have both versions installed simultaneously, but macOS treats them as separate apps for permissions. You'll need to grant permissions separately for each version.

If that fails, use the terminal to reset:

```
# This removes Accessibility permission for a specific bundle ID:
sudo tccutil reset Accessibility sh.vibetunnel.vibetunnel
sudo tccutil reset Accessibility sh.vibetunnel.vibetunnel.debug  # For debug builds

sudo tccutil reset ScreenCapture sh.vibetunnel.vibetunnel
sudo tccutil reset ScreenCapture sh.vibetunnel.vibetunnel.debug  # For debug builds

# This removes all Automation permissions system-wide (cannot target specific apps):
sudo tccutil reset AppleEvents
```
