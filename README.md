# VibeTunnel

VibeTunnel is a Mac app that proxies terminal apps to the web. Now you can use Claude Code anywhere, anytime. Control open instances, read the output, type new commands or even open new instances. Supports macOS 14+.

## Features

- **Remote Terminal Control**: Tunnel connections to control Claude Code and other terminal apps remotely
- **Flexible UI Modes**: Run as a standard dock application or minimal menu bar utility
- **Auto Updates**: Built-in Sparkle integration for seamless updates with stable and pre-release channels

### Code Signing Setup

This project uses xcconfig files to manage developer-specific settings, preventing code signing conflicts when multiple developers work on the project.

**For new developers:**
1. Copy the template: `cp VibeTunnel/Local.xcconfig.template VibeTunnel/Local.xcconfig`
2. Edit `VibeTunnel/Local.xcconfig` and add your development team ID
3. Open the project in Xcode - it will use your settings automatically

See [docs/CODE_SIGNING_SETUP.md](docs/CODE_SIGNING_SETUP.md) for detailed instructions.

### Building

The project uses standard Xcode build system:

```bash
# Debug build
xcodebuild -scheme VibeTunnel -configuration Debug

# Release build
xcodebuild -scheme VibeTunnel -configuration Release

# Run tests
xcodebuild test -scheme VibeTunnel
```

### Release Process

The project includes comprehensive release automation scripts in the `scripts/` directory:

```bash
# Create a new release
./scripts/release.sh --version 1.2.3

# Build and notarize
./scripts/build.sh
./scripts/notarize.sh

# Generate appcast for Sparkle updates
./scripts/generate-appcast.sh
```

## Architecture

VibeTunnel is built with a modular architecture:
