/// Represents a Git worktree in a repository.
///
/// A worktree allows you to have multiple working trees attached to the same repository,
/// enabling you to work on different branches simultaneously without switching contexts.
///
/// ## Overview
///
/// The `Worktree` struct provides comprehensive information about a Git worktree including:
/// - Basic properties like path, branch, and HEAD commit
/// - Status information (detached, locked, prunable)
/// - Statistics about uncommitted changes
/// - UI helper properties for display purposes
///
/// ## Usage Example
///
/// ```swift
/// let worktree = Worktree(
///     path: "/path/to/repo/worktrees/feature-branch",
///     branch: "feature/new-ui",
///     HEAD: "abc123def456",
///     detached: false,
///     prunable: false,
///     locked: nil,
///     lockedReason: nil,
///     commitsAhead: 3,
///     filesChanged: 5,
///     insertions: 42,
///     deletions: 10,
///     hasUncommittedChanges: true,
///     isMainWorktree: false,
///     isCurrentWorktree: true
/// )
/// ```
struct Worktree: Codable, Identifiable, Equatable {
    /// Unique identifier for the worktree instance.
    let id = UUID()

    /// The file system path to the worktree directory.
    let path: String

    /// The branch name associated with this worktree.
    ///
    /// This is the branch that the worktree is currently checked out to.
    let branch: String

    /// The SHA hash of the current HEAD commit.
    let HEAD: String

    /// Indicates whether the worktree is in a detached HEAD state.
    ///
    /// When `true`, the worktree is not on any branch but directly on a commit.
    let detached: Bool

    /// Indicates whether this worktree can be pruned (removed).
    ///
    /// A worktree is prunable when its associated branch has been deleted
    /// or when it's no longer needed.
    let prunable: Bool?

    /// Indicates whether this worktree is locked.
    ///
    /// Locked worktrees cannot be pruned or removed until unlocked.
    let locked: Bool?

    /// The reason why this worktree is locked, if applicable.
    ///
    /// Only present when `locked` is `true`.
    let lockedReason: String?

    /// Number of commits this branch is ahead of the base branch.
    let commitsAhead: Int?

    /// Number of files with uncommitted changes in this worktree.
    let filesChanged: Int?

    /// Number of line insertions in uncommitted changes.
    let insertions: Int?

    /// Number of line deletions in uncommitted changes.
    let deletions: Int?

    /// Indicates whether this worktree has any uncommitted changes.
    ///
    /// This includes both staged and unstaged changes.
    let hasUncommittedChanges: Bool?

    // MARK: - UI Helpers

    /// Indicates whether this is the main worktree (not a linked worktree).
    ///
    /// The main worktree is typically the original repository directory.
    let isMainWorktree: Bool?

    /// Indicates whether this worktree is currently active in VibeTunnel.
    let isCurrentWorktree: Bool?

/// - ``baseBranch``
/// - ``followBranch``

/// logger.info("Active worktrees: \(stats.total - stats.prunable)")
/// ```

    /// If nil, uses the repository's default branch.

///
/// ## Example
///
/// ```swift
/// // Enable follow mode
/// let enableRequest = FollowModeRequest(enabled: true, targetBranch: "develop")
///
/// // Disable follow mode
/// let disableRequest = FollowModeRequest(enabled: false, targetBranch: nil)
/// ```
