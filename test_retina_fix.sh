# Test script to verify retina display screen capture fix
echo "Testing retina display screen capture fix..."

echo "This script will help verify that screen capture now properly handles retina displays."
echo ""
echo "Expected behavior:"
echo "- Desktop capture should now report dimensions with scale factor applied"
echo "- For example, a 1920x1080 display with 2x scale should capture at 3840x2160"
echo ""
echo "Look for these log lines in the console output:"
echo "- 'Desktop stream config - display: WxH (scale: X.X)'"
echo "- 'Combined display bounds: ... maxScale=X.X' (for all displays mode)"
echo ""
echo "To test:"
echo "1. Clean and rebuild VibeTunnel with Xcode"
echo "2. Start VibeTunnel"
echo "3. Open the web interface and start screen capture"
echo "4. Check the Mac app console logs for the scale factor being applied"
echo ""
echo "The fix applies scale factor to:"
echo "- Desktop capture (single display)"
echo "- All displays capture"
echo "- Window capture"
