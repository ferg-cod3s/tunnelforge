## ‚ùó Remaining Gaps for 100% Feature Parity

**Priority 1 - Core Missing Features:**
- [x] Complete Git integration commands (follow, unfollow, git-event) ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] Push notification system with Web Push API and VAPID keys ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] Node.js route parity (logs, control, tmux) ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [ ] Enhanced authentication with SSH keys and PAM integration
- [ ] Session persistence and recovery mechanisms

**Priority 2 - Advanced Features:**
- [ ] Comprehensive session activity tracking and metrics
- [ ] Title management modes (FILTER, STATIC, DYNAMIC)
- [ ] Advanced Git status tracking and worktree support
- [ ] Complete Systemd service management - currently placeholders
- [ ] Multiplexer routes (unified tmux/zellij interface)
- [ ] Worktree management routes
- [ ] Remotes routes (HQ mode)

**Priority 3 - Minor Issues:**
- [x] ~~Health endpoint uptime currently uses `time.Since(time.Now())`; track server start time~~ ‚úÖ FIXED
- [ ] Fix failing security test: HSTS header only appears with HTTPS
- [ ] Git branch operations are cwd-scoped; evaluate path-aware variants or document constraints
- [ ] Bun web server integration refinements

---

## üìå Architecture Notes

- HTTP server: Gorilla Mux + rs/cors; security middlewares exist but must be added to the router stack
- WebSocket: Gorilla WebSocket; origin checks must be enforced for production
- Filesystem and Git services: both enforce base-path restrictions via config; avoid path traversal and command injection by design
- Monitoring: Compose config includes otel-collector, but the Go server doesn‚Äôt export metrics yet

---

## üìà Benchmarks & Tests

- Benchmarks: See `go-server/benchmarks/benchmark_results/*` for recent runs (Aug 6, 2025). Use those artifacts for precise numbers.
- Tests: Unit/integration tests exist across internal packages and pass locally. CI is not configured yet in this repository.
