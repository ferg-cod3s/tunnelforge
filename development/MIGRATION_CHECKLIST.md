# TunnelForge Migration Checklist

Complete validation checklist for migrating from Node.js to Go server implementation.

## üéØ Migration Overview

**Goal**: Replace the Node.js TunnelForge server (`web/`) with the high-performance Go implementation (`go-server/`) while maintaining 100% feature parity and compatibility with existing clients (Mac app, iOS app, web frontend).

**Architecture**: 
- **Go Server** (`go-server/`) ‚Üí Production backend on port 4021
- **Bun Web Frontend** (`bun-web/`) ‚Üí Static file server + API proxy on port 3000
- **Frontend Assets** ‚Üí Served by Bun, API calls proxied to Go server
