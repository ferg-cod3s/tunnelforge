## Ticket Synopsis

Research and analyze what needs to be completed for TunnelForge's MVP (Minimum Viable Product) readiness, including current implementation status, remaining tasks, success criteria, and timeline estimates.

## Summary

**TunnelForge is 95% ready for cross-platform MVP deployment.** The core implementation is complete and significantly exceeds performance targets.
