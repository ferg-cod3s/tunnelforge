# Validate Implementation

You are tasked with validating that an implementation plan was correctly executed, verifying all success criteria and identifying any deviations or issues. This command uses intelligent caching to optimize validation workflows and maintain consistency across similar verification scenarios.

## Purpose

Systematically validate implementation correctness by comparing executed changes against plan specifications, running automated checks, and identifying gaps or improvements needed.

## Inputs

- **plan_path**: Optional path to the implementation plan to validate
- **implementation_scope**: Optional scope for what to validate (current session, recent commits, or full history)
- **strictness**: Optional validation strictness level
- **conversation_context**: History of implementation work and decisions

## Preconditions

- Implementation plan exists and is readable (if path provided)
- Git repository has commit history to analyze
- Development environment configured for running verification commands
- Access to automated testing and build tools

## Process Phases

### Phase 1: Context Analysis & Scope Determination

1. **Check Cache First**: Query cache for similar validation patterns using plan context hash
2. **Determine Validation Scope**: Identify what implementation work needs validation
3. **Locate Implementation Plan**: Find or read the relevant plan document
4. **Gather Implementation Evidence**: Analyze git history and current codebase state
5. **Set Validation Parameters**: Establish strictness level and verification approach

### Phase 2: Systematic Verification

1. **Read Complete Plan**: Understand all phases, changes, and success criteria
2. **Verify Phase Completion**: Check completion markers against actual implementation
3. **Execute Automated Checks**: Run all automated verification commands from plan
4. **Analyze Code Changes**: Compare implemented changes against plan specifications
5. **Assess Manual Criteria**: Identify what requires manual testing and verification

### Phase 3: Analysis & Reporting

1. **Identify Deviations**: Document differences between plan and implementation
2. **Evaluate Edge Cases**: Assess error handling and edge case coverage
3. **Generate Recommendations**: Provide actionable improvement suggestions
4. **Create Validation Report**: Structure findings with clear status and priorities
5. **Update Cache**: Store successful validation patterns for future reviews

## Success Criteria

#### Automated Verification

- [ ] All automated verification commands from plan execute successfully
- [ ] Implementation matches plan specifications for completed phases
- [ ] Git history analysis completes without errors
- [ ] Validation report generated with proper structure
- [ ] Cache updated with successful validation patterns

#### Manual Verification

- [ ] All plan phases are properly validated against implementation
- [ ] Deviations from plan are documented with rationale
- [ ] Manual testing requirements are clearly specified
- [ ] Recommendations are actionable and prioritized
- [ ] Validation report provides clear next steps

## Validation Methodology

### Scope Determination Strategy

- **Current Session**: Validate work done in active conversation
- **Recent Commits**: Analyze last N commits for implementation
- **Full History**: Comprehensive validation against complete plan

### Verification Levels

- **Lenient**: Focus on major functionality, allow minor deviations
- **Standard**: Balance thoroughness with practicality
- **Strict**: Comprehensive validation of all specifications

## Validation Report Structure

## Validation Best Practices

### Systematic Approach

- **Complete Plan Review**: Read entire plan before validation
- **Evidence-Based**: Base findings on actual code and test results
- **Balanced Assessment**: Consider both compliance and improvement opportunities
- **Clear Communication**: Document issues with specific file:line references

### Quality Focus Areas

- **Functional Correctness**: Does implementation solve the problem?
- **Code Quality**: Follows patterns, handles errors, maintainable?
- **Testing Coverage**: Automated and manual testing adequate?
- **Performance Impact**: Any performance implications?
- **Security Considerations**: Secure implementation practices?

## Edge Cases

### Partial Implementation Validation

- Clearly distinguish between completed and incomplete phases
- Document what works vs. what doesn't
- Provide clear guidance on remaining work needed

### Legacy Code Integration

- Assess impact on existing functionality
- Verify backward compatibility
- Check for unintended side effects

### Complex Multi-Phase Plans

- Validate phases independently when possible
- Identify phase interdependencies
- Prioritize critical path validation

## Anti-Patterns

### Avoid These Practices

- **Superficial validation**: Don't skip automated checks for speed
- **Biased assessment**: Don't favor implementation over plan requirements
- **Vague findings**: Don't use generic descriptions without specific references
- **Cache bypass**: Don't skip cache checks for performance reasons

## Caching Guidelines

### Cache Usage Patterns

- **Validation approaches**: Store successful validation methodologies for similar plans
- **Issue patterns**: Cache common findings and resolution approaches
- **Report structures**: Remember effective report organization patterns

### Cache Invalidation Triggers

- **Manual**: Clear cache when validation standards change
- **Content-based**: Invalidate when plan structure changes significantly
- **Time-based**: Refresh cache every 30 minutes for active validation sessions

### Performance Optimization

- Cache hit rate target: ≥ 65% for repeated validation patterns
- Memory usage: < 20MB for validation pattern cache
- Response time: < 100ms for cache queries
