# Deep Research & Analysis Command

Conducts comprehensive research across your codebase, documentation, and external sources to provide deep understanding and actionable insights.

## How It Works

This command orchestrates multiple specialized agents in a carefully designed workflow:

### Phase 1: Discovery (Parallel)
- üîç **codebase-locator** finds relevant files and components
- üìö **thoughts-locator** discovers existing documentation and notes

### Phase 2: Analysis (Sequential)
- üß† **codebase-analyzer** understands implementation details
- üí° **thoughts-analyzer** extracts insights from documentation

### Phase 3: External Research (Optional)
- üåê **web-search-researcher** gathers external context and best practices

## When to Use

**Perfect for:**
- Starting work on unfamiliar parts of the codebase
- Planning new features or major changes
- Understanding complex systems or architectures
- Debugging issues that span multiple components
- Creating onboarding documentation

**Example Research Questions:**
- "How does the user authentication system work?"
- "What's the current state of our API rate limiting?"
- "How should we implement real-time notifications?"
- "What are the performance bottlenecks in our data processing pipeline?"

## What You'll Get

### Research Report Includes:
- **Code Analysis**: File locations, key functions, and implementation patterns
- **Documentation Insights**: Existing docs, decisions, and context
- **Architecture Overview**: How components interact and data flows
- **External Research**: Best practices, alternatives, and recommendations
- **Action Items**: Specific next steps based on findings

### Sample Output Structure:
```
## Research Summary
- Objective: [Your research question]
- Key Findings: [3-5 major insights]
- Confidence Level: [High/Medium/Low]

## Codebase Analysis
- Core Files: [List with explanations]
- Key Functions: [Important methods and their purposes]
- Data Flow: [How information moves through the system]

## Documentation Insights
- Existing Docs: [Relevant documentation found]
- Past Decisions: [Architecture decisions and reasoning]
- Known Issues: [Documented problems or limitations]

## Recommendations
- Immediate Actions: [What to do first]
- Long-term Considerations: [Strategic recommendations]
- Potential Risks: [Things to watch out for]
```

## Pro Tips

1. **Be Specific**: "Research authentication" vs "Research OAuth2 implementation and session management"
2. **Set Context**: Include any constraints, requirements, or specific areas of focus
3. **Follow Up**: Use results to inform `/plan` and `/execute` commands
4. **Iterate**: Research findings often lead to more specific research questions

## Integration with Other Commands

- **‚Üí /plan**: Use research findings to create detailed implementation plans
- **‚Üí /execute**: Begin implementation with full context
- **‚Üí /document**: Create documentation based on research insights
- **‚Üí /review**: Validate that implementation matches research findings
