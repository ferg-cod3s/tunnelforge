# Execute Implementation Plan

You are tasked with implementing an approved technical plan from `docs/plans/`. This command uses intelligent caching to optimize implementation workflows and maintain consistency across similar execution patterns.

## Purpose

Execute technical implementation plans by following structured phases, adapting to real-world constraints, and ensuring all success criteria are met.

## Inputs

- **plan_path**: Path to the implementation plan file in `docs/plans/`
- **ticket_reference**: Optional reference to the original ticket or issue
- **start_phase**: Optional phase number to begin execution from
- **conversation_context**: History of planning and preparation work

## Preconditions

- Implementation plan exists and is readable
- All referenced files in the plan are accessible
- Development environment is properly configured
- Plan has been reviewed and approved for execution

## Process Phases

### Phase 1: Context Analysis & Cache Check

1. **Check Cache First**: Query cache for similar implementation patterns using plan context hash
2. **Read Complete Plan**: Read the entire plan file and check existing progress markers
3. **Gather Context**: Read original ticket and all files mentioned in the plan
4. **Validate Environment**: Ensure all required tools and dependencies are available
5. **Create Execution Plan**: Set up todo list and determine starting point

### Phase 2: Phased Implementation

1. **Execute Current Phase**: Implement the current unchecked phase completely
2. **Adapt to Reality**: Adjust implementation based on actual codebase state
3. **Verify Phase Completion**: Run success criteria checks for the phase
4. **Update Progress**: Mark phase as complete in plan file and todo list
5. **Handle Blockers**: Identify and resolve any implementation obstacles

### Phase 3: Verification & Completion

1. **Run Final Verification**: Execute all success criteria checks
2. **Update Documentation**: Ensure plan reflects final implementation state
3. **Clean Up**: Remove temporary files and reset development environment
4. **Update Cache**: Store successful implementation patterns for future reference

## Success Criteria

#### Automated Verification

- [ ] All plan phases completed successfully
- [ ] Success criteria checks pass for each phase
- [ ] Plan file updated with completion markers
- [ ] No critical blockers remain unresolved
- [ ] Cache updated with successful execution patterns

#### Manual Verification

- [ ] Implementation matches plan intent and requirements
- [ ] Code follows project conventions and standards
- [ ] All edge cases and error conditions handled
- [ ] Documentation updated to reflect changes
- [ ] Testing covers all critical paths

## Implementation Guidelines

### Phase Execution Strategy

- **Complete Before Proceed**: Finish each phase entirely before starting the next
- **Adapt Intelligently**: Follow plan intent while adjusting for real-world constraints
- **Verify Continuously**: Run checks at natural stopping points, not after every change
- **Document Deviations**: Note any significant differences from the original plan

### Handling Plan Mismatches

When the actual codebase differs from the plan:

1. **STOP and Analyze**: Don't proceed until you understand the discrepancy
2. **Present Clearly**: Show expected vs. actual situation with impact analysis
3. **Request Guidance**: Ask for direction on how to proceed
4. **Document Decision**: Update plan with resolution approach

### Verification Best Practices

- **Batch Verification**: Group checks at phase boundaries to maintain flow
- **Fix Issues Immediately**: Don't accumulate technical debt
- **Update Progress Markers**: Keep both plan file and todo list current
- **Trust Completed Work**: Don't re-verify already completed phases

## Edge Cases

### Partial Plan Execution

- Start from specific phase when resuming interrupted work
- Verify previous phases only if inconsistencies are suspected
- Maintain context of what has already been implemented

### Technical Blockers

- Identify root cause before asking for guidance
- Provide multiple solution options when possible
- Document workaround approaches for future reference

### Evolving Requirements

- Compare new requirements against existing implementation
- Assess impact of changes on remaining phases
- Update plan to reflect new understanding

## Anti-Patterns

### Avoid These Practices

- **Rushed implementation**: Don't skip understanding the full context
- **Accumulating debt**: Don't leave verification issues unresolved
- **Plan deviation**: Don't implement differently without clear justification
- **Cache bypass**: Don't skip cache checks for performance reasons

## Caching Guidelines

### Cache Usage Patterns

- **Execution patterns**: Store successful implementation approaches for similar features
- **Blocker resolutions**: Cache solutions to common technical obstacles
- **Verification strategies**: Remember effective testing and validation approaches

### Cache Invalidation Triggers

- **Manual**: Clear cache when implementation standards change
- **Content-based**: Invalidate when plan structure changes significantly
- **Time-based**: Refresh cache every 30 minutes for active development

### Performance Optimization

- Cache hit rate target: â‰¥ 65% for repeated execution patterns
- Memory usage: < 20MB for execution pattern cache
- Response time: < 75ms for cache queries
