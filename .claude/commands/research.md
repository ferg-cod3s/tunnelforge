# Research Codebase

Conduct comprehensive research across the codebase by coordinating specialized agents to explore patterns, context, and insights, then synthesize findings into actionable documentation. Uses intelligent caching for optimization.

## Purpose

Multi-dimensional research via agent coordination for codebase patterns, historical context, and architectural insights, synthesized into documentation.

## Inputs

- **ticket**: Path to ticket file or research question/topic
- **scope**: Optional scope (codebase|thoughts|both)
- **depth**: Optional depth (shallow|medium|deep)
- **conversation_context**: Related research history

## Preconditions

- Valid ticket file or clear question
- Accessible development environment
- Time for comprehensive analysis

## Process Phases

### Phase 1: Context Analysis & Planning

1. Check cache for similar patterns
2. Read ticket/question fully
3. Decompose into investigation areas
4. Create research plan with subtasks
5. Identify agents and strategies

### Phase 2: Parallel Agent Coordination

1. Spawn locators: codebase-locator, thoughts-locator in parallel
2. Pattern analysis: codebase-pattern-finder for examples
3. Deep analysis: codebase-analyzer, thoughts-analyzer on key findings
4. Domain agents: Deploy specialized agents as needed
5. Wait for completion

### Phase 3: Synthesis & Documentation

1. Aggregate agent results
2. Cross-reference findings
3. Generate insights and patterns
4. Create structured research document
5. Update cache with patterns

## Error Handling

### Invalid Ticket

- Phase: context_analysis
- Expected: Valid ticket file/question
- Mitigation: Verify path or clarify question
- Requires user input: true

### Agent Failure

- Phase: agent_execution
- Expected: All agents complete
- Mitigation: Retry or adjust scope
- Requires user input: false

### Insufficient Findings

- Phase: synthesis
- Expected: Adequate findings
- Mitigation: Expand scope/objectives
- Requires user input: true

## Structured Output

```command-output:research_document
{
  "status": "success|in_progress|error",
  "timestamp": "ISO-8601",
  "cache": {"hit": true|false, "key": "pattern:{hash}:{scope}", "ttl_remaining": 3600, "savings": 0.25},
  "research": {"question": "string", "scope": "codebase|thoughts|both", "depth": "shallow|medium|deep"},
  "findings": {"total_files": 23, "codebase": 18, "thoughts": 5, "insights": 7, "patterns": 3},
  "document": {"path": "docs/research/YYYY-MM-DD-topic.md", "sections": ["synopsis", "summary", "findings", "references"], "code_refs": 12, "historical": 3},
  "agents_used": ["codebase-locator", "codebase-analyzer", "thoughts-locator", "thoughts-analyzer"],
  "metadata": {"processing_time": 180, "cache_savings": 0.25, "agent_tasks": 6, "follow_up": 0}
}
```

## Success Criteria

### Automated

- Document created in `docs/research/`
- YAML frontmatter structure
- Agents completed successfully
- File:line references included
- Cache updated

### Manual

- Question fully addressed with evidence
- Cross-component connections
- Actionable development insights
- Historical context integrated
- Open questions addressed

## Agent Coordination

### Execution Order

1. **Discovery**: Locators in parallel (codebase-locator, thoughts-locator)
2. **Pattern Analysis**: codebase-pattern-finder after locators
3. **Deep Analysis**: Analyzers on key findings (codebase-analyzer, thoughts-analyzer)

### Specialized Agents

- operations-incident-commander: Incident response
- development-migrations-specialist: Database migrations
- programmatic-seo-engineer: SEO architecture
- content-localization-coordinator: i18n/l10n
- quality-testing-performance-tester: Performance testing

## Best Practices

### Methodology

- Read primary sources fully before agents
- Run same-type agents in parallel
- Prioritize current codebase over cache
- Identify cross-component relationships

### Documentation

- Consistent YAML frontmatter and sections
- Specific file:line references
- Include temporal context
- Self-contained with necessary context

## Document Template

```markdown
---
date: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ
researcher: Assistant
topic: 'Research Topic'
tags: [research, tags]
status: complete
---

## Synopsis

[Brief summary of question/requirements]

## Summary

[High-level findings]

## Detailed Findings

### Component 1

- Finding ([file.ext:line])
- Connections and patterns

## Code References

- `path/file.ext:line` - Description

## Architecture Insights

[Key patterns and decisions]

## Historical Context

[Insights from docs/]

## Open Questions

[Any further investigation needed]
```

## Edge Cases

### Limited Findings

- Expand scope with alternative terms/patterns
- Document what was not found

### Multi-Component Systems

- Break into sub-questions
- Use multiple agents per aspect
- Separate sections per component

### Historical vs Current

- Prioritize current codebase
- Use docs for context/rationale
- Note discrepancies

## Anti-Patterns

- Spawn agents before reading sources
- Run agents sequentially instead of parallel
- Rely solely on cached documentation
- Skip cache checks

## Caching

### Usage

- Store successful strategies for similar topics
- Cache effective agent combinations
- Remember question decomposition

### Invalidation

- Manual: Clear on standards/structure changes
- Content-based: Significant question changes
- Time-based: Refresh hourly for active sessions

### Performance

- Hit rate ≥60%
- Memory <30MB
- Response <150ms
