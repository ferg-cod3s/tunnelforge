# TunnelForge Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Executive Summary

TunnelForge is a cross-platform terminal sharing and remote access solution that enables developers to access their command-line tools, monitor AI agents, and share terminal sessions through any web browser. Built with a modern tech stack (Go, Bun, Tauri v2), it provides a lightweight, performant alternative to traditional SSH setups and terminal multiplexers.

## Problem Statement

### User Problems
1. **Remote Terminal Access Complexity**: Setting up SSH access requires port forwarding, key management, and firewall configuration
2. **AI Agent Monitoring**: Developers need to monitor long-running AI coding assistants (Claude, ChatGPT) remotely
3. **Terminal Sharing Friction**: Sharing terminal sessions for collaboration or debugging requires complex screen sharing or tmux setups
4. **Mobile Access Limitations**: Accessing development environments from mobile devices is cumbersome
5. **Resource Overhead**: Existing solutions (Electron-based apps) consume excessive system resources

### Market Opportunity
- Growing remote development workforce requiring seamless terminal access
- Increased adoption of AI coding assistants needing monitoring
- Rise in collaborative debugging and pair programming
- Demand for lightweight, native applications over resource-heavy alternatives

## Product Vision

**Vision Statement**: "Make terminal access as simple as opening a web browser, anywhere, anytime."

**Mission**: Provide developers with instant, secure, and efficient access to their terminal sessions from any device, enabling seamless remote work and AI agent monitoring without configuration overhead.
