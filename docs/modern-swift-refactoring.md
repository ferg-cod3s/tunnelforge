# Modern Swift Refactoring Summary

This document summarizes the modernization changes made to the VibeTunnel codebase to align with modern Swift best practices as outlined in `modern-swift.md`.

## Key Changes

### 1. Converted @ObservableObject to @Observable

- **SessionMonitor.swift**: Converted from `@ObservableObject` with `@Published` properties to `@Observable` class
  - Removed `import Combine`
  - Replaced `@Published` with regular properties
  - Changed from `ObservableObject` to `@Observable`

- **TunnelServerDemo.swift**: Converted from `@ObservableObject` to `@Observable`
  - Removed `import Combine`
  - Simplified property declarations

- **SparkleViewModel**: Converted stub implementation to use `@Observable`

### 2. Replaced Combine with Async/Await

- **SessionMonitor.swift**: 
  - Replaced `Timer` with `Task` for periodic monitoring
  - Used `Task.sleep(for:)` instead of Timer callbacks
  - Eliminated nested `Task { }` blocks

- **TunnelClient.swift**:
  - Removed `PassthroughSubject` from WebSocket implementation
  - Replaced with `AsyncStream<WSMessage>` for message handling
  - Updated delegate methods to use `continuation.yield()` instead of `subject.send()`

### 3. Simplified State Management

- **VibeTunnelApp.swift**:
  - Changed `@StateObject` to `@State` for SessionMonitor
  - Updated `.environmentObject()` to `.environment()` for modern environment injection

- **MenuBarView.swift**:
  - Changed `@EnvironmentObject` to `@Environment(SessionMonitor.self)`

- **SettingsView.swift**:
  - Removed `ServerObserver` ViewModel completely
  - Moved server state directly into view as `@State private var httpServer`
  - Simplified server state access with computed properties

### 4. Modernized Async Operations

- **VibeTunnelApp.swift**:
  - Replaced `DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter` with `Task.sleep(for:)`
  - Updated all `Task.sleep(nanoseconds:)` to `Task.sleep(for:)` with Duration

- **SettingsView.swift**:
  - Replaced `.onAppear` with `.task` for async initialization
  - Modernized Task.sleep usage throughout

### 5. Removed Unnecessary Abstractions

- Eliminated `ServerObserver` class - moved logic directly into views
- Removed Combine imports where no longer needed
- Simplified state ownership by keeping it close to where it's used

### 6. Updated Error Handling

- Maintained proper async/await error handling with try/catch
- Removed completion handler patterns where applicable
- Simplified error state management

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Reduced Dependencies**: Removed Combine dependency from most files
2. **Simpler Code**: Eliminated unnecessary ViewModels and abstractions
3. **Better Performance**: Native SwiftUI state management with @Observable
4. **Modern Patterns**: Consistent use of async/await throughout
5. **Cleaner Architecture**: State lives closer to where it's used

## Migration Notes

- All @Observable classes require iOS 17+ / macOS 14+
- AsyncStream provides a more natural API than Combine subjects
- Task-based monitoring is more efficient than Timer-based
- SwiftUI's built-in state management eliminates need for custom ViewModels

## Files Modified

1. `/VibeTunnel/Core/Services/SessionMonitor.swift`
2. `/VibeTunnel/Core/Services/TunnelClient.swift`
3. `/VibeTunnel/Core/Services/TunnelServerDemo.swift`
4. `/VibeTunnel/Core/Services/SparkleUpdaterManager.swift`
5. `/VibeTunnel/VibeTunnelApp.swift`
6. `/VibeTunnel/Views/MenuBarView.swift`
7. `/VibeTunnel/SettingsView.swift`

All changes follow the principles outlined in the Modern Swift guidelines, embracing SwiftUI's native patterns and avoiding unnecessary complexity.
