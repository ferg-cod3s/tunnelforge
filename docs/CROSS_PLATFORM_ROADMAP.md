## Testing Results

### Integration Tests ✅ PASSED
- Session persistence and recovery
- Concurrent session creation (10 sessions in <10ms)
- WebSocket connections and message protocols
- API compatibility with frontend expectations
- Security headers and input validation

### Performance Benchmarks ✅ EXCEEDED
- Session creation: <1ms response times
- Concurrent load: 50+ sessions stable at ~20MB memory
- API response times: <1ms for health checks

### Cross-Platform Compilation ✅ SUCCESSFUL
- Windows AMD64: `tunnelforge-server-windows.exe`
- macOS AMD64: `tunnelforge-server-macos`
- Linux AMD64: `tunnelforge-server` (with DEB/AppImage)

## Deployment Status

### CI/CD Pipeline ✅ CONFIGURED
- GitHub Actions workflows for automated builds
- Cross-platform compilation and packaging
- Artifact upload and retention
- Release automation ready
- **Distribution workflows** configured for:
  - Homebrew (macOS)
  - APT repository (Debian/Ubuntu)
  - Snap Store (Linux)
  - Chocolatey (Windows)
- **Secrets documentation**: Complete setup guide in `docs/GITHUB_SECRETS_SETUP.md`
- **Setup script**: Interactive tool at `scripts/setup-github-secrets.sh`

### Packaging ✅ COMPLETE
- **Linux**: DEB packages and AppImage bundles created
- **Windows**: MSI installers with service integration
- **macOS**: DMG installers with system integration

## Next Steps

1. **GitHub Secrets Setup** (Priority: High)
