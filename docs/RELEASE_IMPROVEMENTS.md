# Release Process Improvements Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Dry-Run Mode Now Actually Dry
- Added proper `--dry-run` flag support that prevents ALL file modifications
- Shows what would be done without making any changes
- Can be used with any release type: `./scripts/release.sh beta 7 --dry-run`

### 2. ✅ Clear Parameter Documentation
- Added `--help` flag with comprehensive usage examples
- Better error messages that show exactly what's expected
- Created `RELEASE_PROCESS.md` with detailed workflow documentation

### 3. ✅ CHANGELOG.md Location Fixed
- Script now looks in project root first (where it actually exists)
- Removed confusing warnings about copying to mac/ directory
- Falls back gracefully if not found

### 4. ✅ iOS Info.plist Fixed
- Changed from hardcoded "1.0" to `$(MARKETING_VERSION)`
- Changed from hardcoded "1" to `$(CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION)`
- Now properly syncs with version.xcconfig

### 5. ✅ Version Management Clarified
- Documented that version.xcconfig is the source of truth
- Script parameters are for validation, not version modification
- Clear examples of correct usage for each release type

## New Features

### Enhanced Error Messages
```bash
# Before: Confusing error
❌ Error: Pre-release number required for beta

# After: Clear guidance
❌ Error: Pre-release number required for beta releases
Usage: ./scripts/release.sh beta <number>
Example: ./scripts/release.sh beta 7
```

### Proper Argument Parsing
- Supports flags in any order
- Validates pre-release numbers are positive integers
- Shows helpful examples on errors

### Comprehensive Documentation
- `docs/RELEASE_PROCESS.md` - Complete workflow guide
- Clear explanation of version vs release type relationship
- Common mistakes and troubleshooting section

## Usage Examples

### Test a release without changes:
```bash
./scripts/release.sh beta 7 --dry-run
```

### Get help:
```bash
./scripts/release.sh --help
```

### Create actual release:
```bash
./scripts/release.sh beta 7
```

## Benefits

1. **Safer**: Dry-run prevents accidental modifications during testing
2. **Clearer**: Better documentation and error messages reduce confusion
3. **Consistent**: iOS now uses same version variables as macOS
4. **Maintainable**: Improved code structure makes future changes easier
