# Missing Features: Alternative Implementations vs Production Mac App

## Overview

TunnelForge has multiple implementations: the **production SwiftUI Mac app** (current, stable), **Go + Bun alternative implementations** (functional), and **future Tauri cross-platform apps** (in development). This document outlines feature gaps between implementations.

## 🍎 **Production Mac App Features** (Reference Implementation)

The SwiftUI Mac app with Node.js server (port 4020) is the reference implementation with all features:

## 🚨 **Priority Missing Features for Go + Bun Implementation**

The Go + Bun implementation is functional for core terminal use but missing some advanced features from the production Mac app:

## 🚨 **Priority Missing Features for Go + Bun Implementation**

The Go + Bun implementation is functional for core terminal use but missing some advanced features from the production Mac app:

### **1. Power Management (Sleep Prevention)**

**What the production Mac app has**:
- **PowerManagementService**: Prevents Mac from sleeping when TunnelForge is running
- **IOKit Integration**: Uses `IOPMAssertionCreateWithName` to create power assertions
- **Automatic Management**: Prevents sleep when server is running, allows sleep when stopped
- **User Preference**: Toggle in settings to enable/disable sleep prevention

**Status in Go + Bun Implementation**: ❌ **NOT IMPLEMENTED**

**Impact**: Users can't rely on long-running terminal sessions - system may sleep and disconnect them

**Implementation Priority**: 🔴 **HIGH** - Essential for reliable terminal access

**Implementation Notes**: Would need cross-platform power management (macOS: IOKit, Linux: systemd-inhibit, Windows: SetThreadExecutionState)

### **2. Tunnel Integration Services**

**What the production Mac app has**:
- **CloudflareService**: Full cloudflared CLI integration with UI controls
- **NgrokService**: Complete ngrok tunnel management with auth token storage
- **TailscaleService**: Tailscale status checking and hostname discovery

**What the Node.js web implementation has**:
- **TailscaleServeService**: Basic Tailscale Serve integration (`tailscale-serve-service.ts`)
- **Limited scope**: Only Tailscale Serve, no ngrok or Cloudflare integration

**Status in Go + Bun Implementation**: ❌ **NOT IMPLEMENTED**

**Impact**: Users can't create remote access tunnels for external access

**Implementation Priority**: 🟡 **MEDIUM** - Important for remote access, but core terminal works without it

#### **Cloudflare Integration**

**What the production Mac app has**:
- **CloudflareService**: Manages cloudflared CLI integration
- **Quick Tunnels**: Creates public URLs without auth tokens
- **Status Monitoring**: Checks if cloudflared is installed and running
- **Process Management**: Starts/stops cloudflared tunnels
- **Public URL Access**: Provides public URLs for remote access

**Status in Go + Bun Implementation**: ❌ **NOT IMPLEMENTED**

**Impact**: Users can't create public tunnels for remote access

**Implementation Priority**: 🟡 **MEDIUM** - Important for remote access functionality

#### **Ngrok Integration**

**What the production Mac app has**:
- **NgrokService**: Manages ngrok tunnel lifecycle
- **Auth Token Management**: Secure storage of ngrok auth tokens
- **Tunnel Creation**: Starts ngrok tunnels on specified ports
- **Status Monitoring**: Tracks tunnel status and public URLs
- **CLI Integration**: Uses ngrok CLI for tunnel management

**Status in Go + Bun Implementation**: ❌ **NOT IMPLEMENTED**

**Impact**: Users can't use ngrok for remote access

**Implementation Priority**: 🟡 **MEDIUM** - Alternative tunneling option

### **3. Native Desktop Integration**

**What the production Mac app provides**:
- **Menu Bar Integration**: System menu bar with native macOS integration
- **System Notifications**: Native macOS notifications and alerts
- **Auto-Updates**: Sparkle framework integration for seamless updates
- **Launch at Login**: Automatic startup with macOS
- **Native File Access**: Full file system access and permissions

**Status in Go + Bun Implementation**: ❌ **NOT AVAILABLE** - Web-based interface limitation

**Impact**: Users lose native desktop experience and system-level integrations

**Implementation Priority**: 🟢 **LOW** - Addressed by future Tauri cross-platform apps

## 📝 **Conclusion**

TunnelForge offers multiple implementations serving different needs:

### **Choose the Right Implementation:**

**🍎 Production Mac App (SwiftUI + Node.js)** - **Recommended for daily use**
- ✅ Complete feature set including power management and tunnel integrations
- ✅ Native macOS integration with menu bar and notifications  
- ✅ Stable and production-ready
- **Best for**: Mac users who want full feature set and native experience

**⚡ Go + Bun Alternative** - **For performance enthusiasts and developers**
- ✅ Superior performance (lower memory, faster response times)
- ✅ Core terminal functionality is complete and stable
- ❌ Missing power management and tunnel integrations
- **Best for**: Development, testing, or when you prioritize raw performance

**🌍 Future Tauri Cross-Platform** - **For cross-platform needs**
- 🔄 In development for Windows, Linux, and macOS
- 🔄 Will leverage Go server backend for core functionality
- **Best for**: Windows/Linux users who want native desktop experience

### **Implementation Status Summary:**
- **Production Ready**: SwiftUI Mac app ✅
- **Performance Alternative**: Go + Bun ✅ (core features) + 🚧 (advanced features)
- **Cross-Platform Future**: Tauri apps 🔄

The Go + Bun implementation proves TunnelForge's architecture is solid and can support multiple backends. Missing features are primarily convenience/advanced functionality rather than core terminal capabilities.
