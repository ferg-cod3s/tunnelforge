# iOS App Update Progress

This document tracks the implementation progress of updating the VibeTunnel iOS app to match all features available in the JavaScript front-end.

## Update Progress

### Completed Features ✅

1. **Fixed Session Creation API** 
   - Changed `spawnTerminal` default from `false` to `true` in `Session.swift`
   - This was the critical bug preventing sessions from being created

2. **Fixed Session Cleanup Endpoint**
   - Changed from `/api/cleanup-exited` to `DELETE /api/sessions` in `APIClient.swift`
   - Now matches the JavaScript implementation

3. **Implemented SSE Client**
   - Created `SSEClient.swift` for Server-Sent Events streaming
   - Handles text-based terminal output streaming
   - Parses event format: `[timestamp, type, data]`
   - Handles exit events: `['exit', exitCode, sessionId]`

4. **Added Terminal Renderer Switcher**
   - Created `TerminalRenderer.swift` enum for renderer selection
   - Added debug menu in `TerminalView.swift` to switch between renderers
   - Persists selection in UserDefaults

5. **Created xterm WebView Implementation**
   - Created `XtermWebView.swift` using WKWebView
   - Loads xterm.js from CDN
   - Handles terminal input/output via message handlers
   - Supports both WebSocket and SSE data sources

6. **Added File Preview with Syntax Highlighting**
   - Added `previewFile()` and `getGitDiff()` methods to `APIClient.swift`
   - Created `FilePreviewView.swift` with WebView-based syntax highlighting
   - Uses highlight.js for code highlighting
   - Supports text, image, and binary file previews

7. **Added Git Diff Viewer**
   - Integrated into `FilePreviewView.swift`
   - Shows diffs with proper syntax highlighting
   - Accessible from file preview screen

8. **Updated File Browser**
   - Modified `FileBrowserView.swift` to use new preview system
   - Replaced QuickLook with custom FilePreviewView

9. **Added System Logs Viewer**
   - Added logs API endpoints to `APIClient.swift` (`getLogsRaw`, `getLogsInfo`, `clearLogs`)
   - Created `SystemLogsView.swift` with full feature parity:
     - Real-time log display with 2-second auto-refresh
     - Filter by log level (All, Error, Warn, Log, Debug)
     - Filter by source (Client/Server)
     - Text search functionality
     - Auto-scroll toggle
     - Download logs capability
     - Clear logs with confirmation
   - Added access from Settings → Advanced → View System Logs

10. **Added URL Detection in Terminal**
   - SwiftTerm already has built-in URL detection (confirmed in code)
   - xterm.js implementation includes WebLinksAddon for URL detection
   - Settings toggle exists: "Detect URLs" in General Settings

11. **Added Cast File Import**
   - Added file importer to SessionListView
   - Menu option: "Import Recording" in ellipsis menu
   - Supports .json and .data file types (Asciinema cast files)
   - Opens CastPlayerView with imported file
   - Created CastFileItem wrapper for Identifiable conformance

### All Features Completed! ✅

All features from the JavaScript front-end have been successfully implemented in the iOS app.

## Key Files Modified

- `Session.swift` - Fixed spawn_terminal default value
- `APIClient.swift` - Fixed endpoints, added preview/diff/logs APIs
- `SSEClient.swift` - New SSE implementation
- `TerminalRenderer.swift` - New renderer selection enum
- `XtermWebView.swift` - New WebView-based terminal
- `FilePreviewView.swift` - New file preview with syntax highlighting
- `TerminalView.swift` - Added renderer switcher
- `FileBrowserView.swift` - Updated to use new preview
- `SystemLogsView.swift` - New system logs viewer
- `SettingsView.swift` - Added logs viewer access
- `SessionListView.swift` - Added cast file import functionality

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Create new sessions
- [x] Terminal output appears correctly
- [x] Terminal input and special keys work
- [x] WebSocket reconnection works
- [x] File browser and preview work
- [x] Git integration features work
- [x] Session management operations work
- [x] Error handling and offline mode work
- [x] Terminal renderer switching works
- [x] System logs viewer works

## Summary

The iOS app has been successfully updated with all critical and most medium-priority features from the JavaScript front-end. The app now has:

- Full server communication compatibility
- Multiple terminal renderer options (native SwiftTerm and web-based xterm.js)
- File preview with syntax highlighting
- Git diff viewing
- System logs viewer
- All necessary API endpoint fixes

The remaining features (URL detection and cast file import) are low priority and the app is now fully functional with the current server implementation.
