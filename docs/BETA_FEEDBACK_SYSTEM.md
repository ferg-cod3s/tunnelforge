    # Impact factors
    if issue.platform == 'cross-platform':
        base_score += 3
    elif issue.platform in ['windows', 'linux', 'macos']:
        base_score += 2
    
    # User factors
    if issue.reporter in beta_testers:
        base_score += 1
    if issue.reporter in enterprise_testers:
        base_score += 2
    
    # Content factors
    if 'crash' in issue.title.lower():
        base_score += 3
    if 'security' in issue.title.lower():
        base_score += 2
    if 'performance' in issue.title.lower():
        base_score += 1
